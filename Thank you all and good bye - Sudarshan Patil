Dear All
After 5 years of exciting and memorable stint with Citi, I am bidding adieu today to this role to pursue other career opportunities. 
As I move on, I would like to take a moment to remember and cherish our times together.  It’s been great interacting and knowing each one of you.  Thank you all for your support, patience, and friendship over the past years. You are a special group of people and I will definitely miss you.
I would like to thank especially to my team  Anji, Johnny, Vijay, Kelvin, Ansari and Jasmine  for support throughout the journey . I was fortunate to work under Peri , Divyesh , Anand, Sukumar as they has guided me in such a manner that I have gained good technical/domain/functional knowledge in Payments field which would help me in my career.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the complete TTS Team along with CTI Teams, Operations for all the co-ordination these
This is not a goodbye, only “hasta luego” or “see you later”.
